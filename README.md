 This project is to explain my data Analysis journey with LITA, starting from
*	Microsoft  Excel
*	SQL – Structure Query Language
*	Github  for Portfolio Building
*	POWERBI-  Business Intelligence

### DATA ANALYSIS SOURCES
The primary sources of Data used are data generated in the course of training or through online source data e.g Google Data, Kaggle, e.t.c.

### DATA ANALYSIS TOOLS
- 	Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
1. For  Data Cleaning
2. For Data Analysis
3. For Data Visualization

- SQL- Structured Query Language for Query of Data
-	Github for Portfolio Building
-	POWERBI for Data Visualization

### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
The process of cleaning and preparing data involves difference steps which include:
- 	Data loading and inspection
-  Handling missing variables
- 	Data cleaning and formatting 

### DATA EXPLORATION 
Data Exploration involves the exploring of data used during the course of training
- 	What is the total sum of amount generated?
- 	What is the total average of amount generated?
- 	What is the number of regions?

 ### DATA ANALYSIS
 This is where we include some basic line codes or queries used during the analysis.
 
 ```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE  EMPLOYEE
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
